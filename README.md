## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this project was to analyze a number of stocks over different years. The code created loops through the stock data to collect and output information on the Total Daily Volume and Return of those stocks.
---
## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
### The results of this analysis is that the overall stock portfolio did better in year 2017 than it did in 2018. Stock ticker DQ had the highest Return percentage in 2017 with 199.4% but had the worst Return percentage in 2018 with -62.6%. Our code can now account for any new years going forward should we inout the data in sepereate wokseets for that year. it may be helpful to analyze these stocks for other years to get a more clear view of performance history.
### The refactored code also produced much faster execution times for the analysis. Both years took about the same amount of execution time.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? One pro of the refactored script is that the execution was cut down by milliseconds. This is more efficient when having to analyze multiple stock portfolios across different years.
