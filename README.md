## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this project was to analyze a number of stocks over different years. The original script was refactored to create loops through the stock data to collect and output information on the Total Daily Volume and Return of those stocks.
---
## Results
### The result of this analysis is that the overall stock portfolio did better in year 2017 than it did in 2018. Stock ticker DQ had the highest Return percentage in 2017 with 199.4% but had the worst Return percentage in 2018 with -62.6%. Our code can now account for any new years going forward. If the data is input into seperate workseets for each year. It may be helpful to analyze these stocks for other years to get a more clear view of performance history.
### The refactored code also produced faster execution times for the analysis. Both years took about the same amount of execution time (shown in images below) as opposed to roughly .95 seconds in the original script.

## Summary

### The biggest advantage of refactoring code is to produce a better quality and faster executing code. You can potentially clean up a code to make it more efficient and flexible for future datasets. The biggest disadvanteage of refactoring code is that you can get easily confused when debugging your new code. A code may work just fine the first time you run it, then you may get an error that you cannot understand how to undo once you refactor. 

### This script gave me lots of errors when I tried to refactor. Having to figure out the best possible steps to produce my analysis took lots of time and debugging. One pro of the refactored script is that the execution was cut down by milliseconds.This is more efficient when having to analyze multiple stock portfolios across different years.
